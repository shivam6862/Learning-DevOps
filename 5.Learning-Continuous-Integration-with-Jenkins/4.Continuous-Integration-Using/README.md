## Jenkins Continuous Integration Design

### The Branching Strategy

#### Overview:

The branching strategy defines how code changes are managed in version control. Common strategies include feature branches, integration branches, and release branches.

#### Implementation:

1. **Feature Branches:**
   - Developers create branches for specific features or bug fixes.
2. **Integration Branch:**
   - Changes from feature branches are merged into an integration branch for testing.

## The Continuous Integration Pipeline

#### Overview:

The CI pipeline outlines the sequence of steps from code development to deployment. It typically includes building, testing, and deploying code.

## Jenkins Pipeline to Poll the Feature Branch, Integration Branch

#### Overview:

A Jenkins pipeline automates the CI/CD process, allowing continuous integration and deployment.

#### Steps:

1. **Pipeline Script:**

   - Write a pipeline script in Jenkins DSL (Domain Specific Language).

2. **Polling Feature Branch:**

   - Configure Jenkins to poll feature branches for changes.

3. **Integration Branch:**
   - Define steps to merge feature branches into an integration branch.

## Toolset for Continuous Integration

### Overview:

The toolset for CI includes various technologies and tools needed for building, testing, and deploying code.

### Components:

1. **Java:**
   - Programming language often used in CI projects.
2. **Maven:**

   - Build automation tool for Java projects.

3. **JUnit:**

   - Unit testing framework for Java.

4. **Apache Tomcat Server:**

   - Servlet container for deploying Java web applications.

5. **Eclipse IDE:**

   - Integrated development environment for Java.

6. **Jenkins:**

   - CI/CD automation server.

7. **Git:**

   - Distributed version control system.

8. **SourceTree:**

   - Git GUI client.

9. **SonarQube Static:**
   - Code quality and static analysis tool.

## Setting up a Version Control System

### Steps:

1. **Installing SourceTree:**

   - Download and install SourceTree for Git management.

2. **Creating a Repository inside Git:**

   - Create a new Git repository using SourceTree or Git commands.

3. **Using Git Commands:**

   - Learn and use essential Git commands for version control.

4. **Uploading Code to Git Repository:**
   - Push code changes to the Git repository.

## Configuring Jenkins

### Overview:

Configuring Jenkins involves setting up plugins, environments, and jobs.

### Steps:

1. **Installing the Git Plugin:**

   - Install the Git plugin to enable Jenkins to interact with Git repositories.

2. **Installing and Configuring JDK:**

   - Download and install the Java Development Kit (JDK).
   - Configure Java environment variables.

3. **Configuring JDK inside Jenkins:**

   - Specify the JDK installation location in Jenkins.

4. **Installing and Configuring Maven:**

   - Download and install Maven.
   - Set Maven environment variables.

5. **Configuring Maven inside Jenkins:**

   - Specify the Maven installation location in Jenkins.

6. **Installing the E-mail Extension Plugin:**
   - Install the plugin for advanced email notifications.

## The Jenkins Pipeline to Poll the Feature Branch

### Steps:

1. **Creating a Jenkins Job to Poll, Build, and Unit Test Code on the Feature1 Branch:**

   - Configure a Jenkins job to monitor and build code changes on the feature1 branch.

2. **Polling Version Control System Using Jenkins:**

   - Set up Jenkins to poll the version control system for changes.

3. **Compiling and Unit Testing the Code on the Feature Branch:**

   - Define build steps to compile and run unit tests on the feature branch.

4. **Publishing Unit Test Results:**

   - Configure Jenkins to publish unit test results.

5. **Publishing Javadoc:**

   - Include steps to generate and publish Javadoc.

6. **Configuring Advanced E-mail Notification:**
   - Set up advanced email notifications for build status.

## Creating a Jenkins Job to Merge Code to the Integration Branch

### Steps:

1. **Using the Build Trigger Option to Connect Two or More Jenkins Jobs:**
   - Configure the build trigger to connect the job for merging code to the integration branch with the previous job.

## Creating a Jenkins Job to Poll, Build, and Unit Test Code on the Feature2 Branch

### Steps:

1. **Creating a Jenkins Job to Merge Code to the Integration Branch:**
   - Configure a Jenkins job to monitor and build code changes on the feature2 branch.

## Creating a Jenkins Job to Merge Code to the Integration Branch

### Steps:

1. **Creating a Jenkins Job to Merge Code to the Integration Branch:**
   - Configure a Jenkins job to merge code changes from feature branches to the integration branch.
   - Name your new Jenkins job Merge_Feature2_Into_Integration_Branch. Alternatively, use any name that makes sense.
   - Select the type of job as Copy existing Item and type Merge*Feature1* Into_Integration_Branch in the Copy from field.
   - Click on OK to proceed.
   - Scroll down to the Build Triggers section and select the Build after other projects are built option
