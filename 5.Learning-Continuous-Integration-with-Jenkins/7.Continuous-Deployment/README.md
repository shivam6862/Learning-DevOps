# Continuous Deployment Using Jenkins

## What is Continuous Deployment?

### Overview:

Continuous Deployment (CD) is an extension of Continuous Delivery, where every code change that passes automated testing is automatically deployed to production. The goal is to minimize manual intervention in the release process, allowing for faster and more frequent releases.

## How Continuous Deployment is Different from Continuous Delivery

### Differences:

- **Continuous Delivery (CD):**
  - Code changes are automatically tested and can be manually deployed to production.
- **Continuous Deployment (CD):**
  - Code changes are automatically tested and deployed to production without manual intervention.

## Who Needs Continuous Deployment?

### Scenarios:

- Organizations aiming for rapid and frequent software releases.
- Projects with a mature and reliable automated testing and deployment infrastructure.

## Frequent Downtime of the Production Environment with Continuous Deployment

### Challenges:

- Continuous Deployment may lead to frequent updates, potentially causing downtime.
- Effective strategies for minimizing downtime need to be implemented.

## Continuous Deployment Design

### Design Considerations:

- Designing a system that can automatically and safely deploy changes to production.
- Ensuring robust testing and monitoring mechanisms to catch issues before deployment.

## The Continuous Deployment Pipeline

### Overview:

- Similar to Continuous Delivery, the Continuous Deployment pipeline includes automated stages from development to production.
- Key difference: In Continuous Deployment, the production deployment stage is automated.

### Pipeline to Poll the Feature Branch

#### Steps:

1. **Pipeline Script:**
   - Write a Jenkins pipeline script to poll the feature branch for changes.
2. **Automated Testing:**
   - Include stages for automated testing of changes.

### Pipeline to Poll the Integration Branch

#### Steps:

1. **Pipeline Script:**
   - Write a Jenkins pipeline script to poll the integration branch for changes.
2. **Automated Merging and Testing:**
   - Automate the process of merging changes from feature branches to the integration branch and testing.

## Toolset for Continuous Deployment

### Components:

1. **Java:**
   - Programming language.
2. **Apache Tomcat Server:**

   - Servlet container for deploying applications.

3. **Jenkins:**
   - CI/CD automation server.

### Configuring the Production Server

#### Steps:

1. **Installing Java on the Production Server:**

   - Install Java on the production server.

2. **Installing Apache Tomcat Server on the Production Server:**
   - Set up Tomcat on the production server.

### Jenkins Configuration

#### Steps:

1. **Configuring Jenkins Slaves on the Production Server:**
   - Configure Jenkins to use slaves on the production server.

## Creating the Jenkins Continuous Deployment Pipeline

### Steps:

1. **Modifying the Existing Jenkins Job:**

   - Enhance an existing Jenkins job to fit into the CD pipeline.

2. **Modifying the Jenkins Job for Performance Testing:**

   - Adjust the job for performance testing.

3. **Creating a Jenkins Job to Merge Code to the Production Branch:**

   - Configure a job for merging code from the integration branch to the production branch.

4. **Creating the Jenkins Job to Deploy Code to the Production Server:**
   - Set up a job for deploying code to the production server.

## Creating a Nice Visual Flow for the Continuous Deployment Pipeline

### Overview:

- Visualize the CD pipeline for better understanding and monitoring.

### Steps:

1. **Creating Visual Flow:**
   - Use tools or plugins to create a visual representation of the CD pipeline.

## Continuous Deployment in Action

### Steps:

1. **Jenkins Continuous Deployment Pipeline Flow in Action:**

   - Observe how the CD pipeline is triggered and progresses after code changes.

2. **Exploring the Jenkins Job to Merge Code to the Master Branch:**

   - Navigate through Jenkins to explore the job for merging code to the master branch.

3. **Exploring the Jenkins Job that Deploys Code to Production:**
   - Explore the job responsible for deploying code to the production server.
